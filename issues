polipo / crawlera
description: requests not being routed through crawlera, using host ip instead.
remedy: accessed the polipo interface via localhost/polipo/<whatever>, initially with parent proxy configs
still in place, then with them turned off (results: "Website crawl ban" when switched on and successful when off.)
This process seemed to fix the problem.
